📌 Overview
The Broken But Building Grit Counter is a motivational app designed to track your progress toward a personal goal, no matter how small the steps. 
The app simulates a simple counter mechanic where you can increment, decrement, and reset a value — representing reps, hours, tasks, or any form of “grit” you’re building over time.

It’s more than just a counter — it’s a visual reminder that every click and every point counts toward your long-term growth.

🛠 Features
Increment & Decrement — Add or subtract from your counter with a single click.
Reset Function — Bring your counter back to zero instantly.
Motivational Quote Display — Shows a rotating set of motivational messages for encouragement.
Light/Dark Mode Toggle — Switch between a bright and dark interface for your preferred working environment.
Persistent Storage — Saves your progress in localStorage so it remains even after closing the browser.
